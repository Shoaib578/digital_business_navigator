				<h1>What is Digital Business Navigator?</h1>
				<!-- Page Description -->
				<p>The Digital Readiness Level (DRL) Tool was ideated with a clear objective in mind: to create a standardised tool which will help companies to measure and therefore improve their digital maturity.

					The tool is designed to work in a similar way as the now well stablished models for Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL): they have an open standard approach to allow and promote direct comparison and benchmarking with other companies of your size, sector and region.
					
					The DRL Tool is designed to provide a company with an opportunity to take a detailed look at where they are in respect to the digital journey and to assess and prioritise their future actions to identify and reach an appropriate position.</p>

					<h2>Demystifying Digital Technology</h2>
					<!-- Story -->
					<p>The DRL-Tool helps you plan your journey to success enabled by the right digital technologies. By “digital technologies” we mean what the Made Smarter Review refers to as industrial digitalisation technologies (IDTs). They come in various forms and various levels of maturity, ranging across artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics, and analytics. Together, they are driving what is being called the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Digital technologies range across artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics, and analytics .. and include sensors and big data, additive manufacturing and augmented reality. </p>
